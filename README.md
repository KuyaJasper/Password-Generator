# Password-Generator

For this assignment, I did some research and used the ".concact" method to help me simplify the input of the user choices from the windom prompts. Out of all the youtube videos and sites I used to do research on javascript, This was the most helpful in framing my code for my array conditions.

I used previous assignments to help me come up with the math.

Online Sources that helped me out.

[.concact]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat )

[.push]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)

[.join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join)


In the Javascript, I sorted everything under the function paramater given to us in the starter code, "generatePassword". I noticed that the main function being executed was "writePassword", and "generatePassword" was undefined.

After getting the JS where I wanted it to be, I noticed that the H2 tag in the HTML was not cenetered whenever I loaded the page. In the CSS file I centered it on the page whenever the site loaded to clean up the page.

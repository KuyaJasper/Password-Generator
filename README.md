# Password-Generator

For this assignment I did some research and used the concact method to help me simplify the input of the user choices from the windom prompts.

Out of all the youtube videos and sites I used to do research on javascript. This was the most helpful in framing my code for my array conditions.

I used previous assignments to help me come up with the math.
